description: Detect edge intersections with nodes while dragging.

import { RemoteCodeViewer } from 'xy-shared/server';

This example shows how you can detect an intersection between a dragged node and an edge.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The default [`interactionWidth`](/api-reference/types/default-edge-options#interaction-width) of the edges, is set to `75`, via the [`defaultEdgeOptions`](/api-reference/react-flow#default-edge-options) to have a wider interaction area, so that the intersection between the edge and node can be found out easily.
